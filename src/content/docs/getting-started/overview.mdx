## What is EasyTest?

EasyTest is a testing framework that simplifies the process of writing and running tests for your applications. It provides a user-friendly interface and powerful features to help you ensure the quality and reliability of your code.
With EasyTest, you can easily create and manage test cases, run them with a single command, and generate detailed reports on test results. Whether you're testing web applications, APIs, or any other type of software, EasyTest has you covered.

## Core features:

- No need to import `it`, `test`, `describe` or `expect` in your test file. These functions are available globally.
- Test `JavaScript` and `TypeScript` code at one time.
- Asynchronous code testing.
- Global `DOM` object for testing `HTML elements`.
- Built-in `coverage` tool.
- `Verbose` or non verbose mode.
- `Mock` functions and objects.
- Big set of built-in matchers.
- Extend `expect` function with your own matchers.
- Compatible with `codecov` report viewer.
- A lot of expects in one test case.
- Setup and Teardown functions (`beforeEach`, `afterEach`, `beforeAll`, `afterAll`).
- `Watching mode` and `parallel` test executing.

## Why?
While working on [Metro UI](https://metroui.org.ua) and [EasyQuery](https://korzh.com), there was a need to test code with support for DOM tests. EasyTest was created for these purposes.

EasyTest was created as a framework for general testing with DOM support and the ability to test entire HTML pages, **but it can be used for any JavaScript/TypeScript project**.
