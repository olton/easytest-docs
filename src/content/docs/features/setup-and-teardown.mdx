Often while writing tests, you have some setup work that needs to happen before tests run, and you have some finishing work that needs to happen after tests run. 

EasyTest provides helper functions to handle this. These functions are called hooks. Hooks are functions that allow you to run code before or after each test case or test suite.

The following hooks are available to you:
- [`beforeAll()`](#beforeall)
- [`afterAll()`](#afterall)
- [`beforeEach()`](#beforeeach)
- [`afterEach()`](#aftereach)

They're useful for setting up and tearing down test environments, initializing variables, or performing any other necessary actions.

:::caution
You must specify hooks in the test file, in the global scope or inside a `describe` blocks.
:::

```js
beforeAll(() => {
    // Code to run before all tests
})

describe(`Common tests suite`, () => {
    it(`1 === 1`, () => {
        expect(1).toBe(1)
    })
})
```

### beforeAll()

This method is used to run a function before all tests in a test file. It takes a callback function as its argument.

```js
beforeAll(() => {
    // Code to run before all tests
})
```

### afterAll()

This method is used to run a function after all tests in a test file. It takes a callback function as its argument.

```js
afterAll(() => {
    // Code to run after all tests
})
```

### beforeEach()
This method is used to run a function before each test case. It takes a callback function as its argument.

```js
beforeEach(() => {
    // Code to run before each test
})
```

### afterEach()
This method is used to run a function after each test case. It takes a callback function as its argument.

```js
afterEach(() => {
    // Code to run after each test
})
```
