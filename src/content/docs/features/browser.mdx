If you need to interact with a website, you can use the built-in headless browser. This is useful for web scraping, testing, and more.
We use [`Puppeteer`](https://pptr.dev/) to create a headless browser. 

:::tip
`Pupperteer` is a Node.js library that provides a high-level API over the Chrome DevTools Protocol.
:::

## Access to the Browser

The `Browser` object is available in the global scope with `B` name. Also, you can import it from the `easytest` package.

```js
import { B } from "@olton/easytest";

beforeAll(async () => {
    await B.create();
});

afterAll(async () => {
    await B.bye();
});

describe("Google", () => {
    it("Search", async () => {
        await B.visit("https://example.com");
        const title = await B.document.title();
        expect(title).toBe("Example Domain");
    });
});
```

## Methods
The `Browser` object provides a set of methods to interact with the browser. The methods are grouped into categories for better organization.

## Core

### `B.create()`

Creates a new browser instance. This method returns a promise that resolves when the browser is ready to use.

```js
const options = {
    headless: "shell",
    args: [
        '--no-sandbox',
    ],
    detached: true,
    dumpio: false,
    env: {},
    executablePath: undefined,
    handleSIGHUP: true,
    handleSIGINT: true,
    handleSIGTERM: true,
    onExit: undefined,
    pipe: false,
    log: false,
    coverage: {
        filter: '',
        reportFileName: 'lcov-browser.info',
        includeRawScriptCoverage: true,
        reportAnonymousScripts: true,
        resetOnNavigation: true,
        useBlockCoverage: true,
    }
};
await B.create(options);
