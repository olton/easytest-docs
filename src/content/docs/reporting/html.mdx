The HTML reporter generates a detailed HTML report of your test results. This report includes information about passed and failed tests, as well as any errors or warnings that occurred during the test run. The HTML report can be easily shared with team members or stakeholders.

## Usage

To use the HTML reporter, simply run your tests with the `--report-type=html` options set. For example:

```bash
latte --coverage --report-type=html
```

## Report Directory

This will generate an HTML report in the `coverage` directory by default. You can specify a different output directory using the `--report-dir` option:

```bash
latte --coverage --report-type=html --report-dir=reports
```

## Report File

You can also specify a custom report file name using the `--report-file` option. For example:

```bash
latte --coverage --report-type=html --report-file=report.html
```

This will generate an HTML report with the specified file name in the `coverage` directory. You can open this file in a web browser to view the detailed test results.
