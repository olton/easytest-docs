The JUnit reporter generates a report in the JUnit XML format. This report can be used with various CI/CD tools to integrate test results into your build pipeline. The JUnit report includes information about passed and failed tests, as well as any errors or warnings that occurred during the test run.

## Usage

To use the JUnit reporter, simply run your tests with the `--report-type=junit` options set. For example:

```bash
latte --coverage --report-type=junit
```

## Report Directory
This will generate a JUnit report in the `coverage` directory by default. You can specify a different output directory using the `--report-dir` option:

```bash
latte --coverage --report-type=junit --report-dir=reports
```

## Report File
You can also specify a custom report file name using the `--report-file` option. For example:

```bash
latte --coverage --report-type=junit --report-file=report.xml
```

This will generate a JUnit report with the specified file name in the `coverage` directory. You can use this file to integrate test results into your CI/CD pipeline or share it with your team.
