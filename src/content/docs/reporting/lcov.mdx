The LCOV reporter generates a coverage report in the LCOV format. This report can be used with various code coverage tools to visualize the coverage of your tests. 
The LCOV report includes information about which lines of code were executed during the test run and which lines were not.

## Usage

To use the LCOV reporter, simply run your tests with the `--report-type=lcov` options set. For example:

```bash
easytest --coverage --report-type=lcov
```

## Report Directory

This will generate an LCOV report in the `coverage` directory by default. You can specify a different output directory using the `--report-dir` option:

```bash
easytest --coverage --report-type=lcov --report-dir=reports
```

## Report File

You can also specify a custom report file name using the `--report-file` option. For example:

```bash
easytest --coverage --report-type=lcov --report-file=coverage.info
```


The LCOV report will be saved in the specified directory, and you can use it with various code coverage tools to visualize the coverage of your tests.
