You can debug your tests using IDE's built-in debugging tools. This allows you to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through your code to identify issues.

To debug your tests in WebStorm, follow these steps:

1. Open `Run/Debug Configurations` in WebStorm.
2. Click on the `+` icon to add a new configuration.
3. Select `Node.js` from the list.
4. In the `File` field, add the following: `node_modules/@olton/latte/cli/latte.js`.
5. In the `Application parameters` field, add your enable debug option: `--debug`. If you need to pass any other parameters. For example: `--debug --dom`.
6. In the `Working directory` field, set the path to your project directory.
7. Click `OK` to save the configuration.
8. Add command `debugger` in your test files where you want to pause execution.

```js title="example.test.js"
describe(`Array tests`, () => {
    it('toBeArray [] == []', () => {
        debugger
        return expect([]).toBeArray()
    })
})
```

Now you can run the debugger by selecting the configuration you created and clicking the `Debug` button. The execution will pause at the `debugger` statement, allowing you to inspect variables and step through your code.

To debug your tests in VSC, follow these steps:

1. Open the `Run and Debug` panel in VSC (Ctrl+Shift+).
2. Click on `create a launch.json file`.
3. Select `Node.js` from the list.
4. In the `program` field, add the following: `${workspaceFolder}/node_modules/@olton/latte/cli/latte.js`.
5. In the `args` field, add your enable debug option: `--debug`. If you need to pass any other parameters. For example: `--debug --dom`.
6. In the `cwd` field, set the path to your project directory.
7. Click `OK` to save the configuration.
8. Add command `debugger` in your test files where you want to pause execution.
9. Now you can run the debugger by selecting the configuration you created and clicking the `Run` button. The execution will pause at the `debugger` statement, allowing you to inspect variables and step through your code.
